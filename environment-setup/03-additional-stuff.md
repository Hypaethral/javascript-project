# Additional Development Goodies (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

## Typescript
Let's add Typescript to our previous configuration, because type-safe, refactorable javascript is juicy productivity gold when working on larger projects!  In other words, if you're taking the time to set up a robust editing environment, odds are you want to be using something like this to help with code completion and maintainability.

#### Wait, but what exactly is it?
Remember that our node features were made possible by transpiling a superset of javascript with extra language features (es6) to the dumb old browser es5.  Typescript works exactly the same way -- it's a language designed on top of Javascript which can be transpiled to plain old browser JavaScript.  In that sense, JavaScript that's already in your project is *already* valid TypeScript, with no additional coding required.  This means we can introduce TypeScript slowly to an existing project over time, which is super handy when you want to start using it on a project in progress.

#### How does it work?
* talk about type definition files


## React

## Reflux

## Stylus

## Project Structure

# Other Stuff

### Linting

### Testing

### Version Control
* Never commit the node_modules or dist folders -- that's like giving your neighbor your entire fridge of food instead of a recipe for making a sheet of cookies. 

* stub: starting in a project that already exists

### Debugging

### Continuous Integration
