# WHY?


Because javascript development environments have become their own ecosystems at this point.

Understanding why this is the case may help you understand why the steps outlined in the [environment-setup](https://github.com/Hypaethral/javascript-projects/blob/master/environment-setup/environment-setup.md) project are as close to 
necessary as you can get without *technically* being required to write JS.

## A picture is worth 1000 words, so here's the gist of it:

## Transpa who now?  BOOM, ANOTHER 1000 WORDS:

## Hmm.. 

So the stuff you're about to do in this [environment-setup](https://github.com/Hypaethral/javascript-projects/blob/master/environment-setup/environment-setup.md) project is going to make it easier and more convenient to code in Javascript,
mainly by setting up a transpilation process.  This is so we can take advantage of some cool stuff people have written, but isn't understood yet by browsers (which is where we usually care about javascript running).
