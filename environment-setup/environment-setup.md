# Set Up A Brofessional Editing Environment

*Check out the ["why this matters" document](https://github.com/Hypaethral/javascript-projects/blob/master/environment-setup/why-does-this-matter.md) before starting!*

*As far as projects go, this won't necessarily have a submission, just a helpful thing in case you don't already have a javascript development environment or in case you run into an issue with a technology listed below.*

*Speaking of, I'll be using VSCode for parts that specify an IDE.  If you get lost or run into issues using your preferred editor, at least get it set up in VSCode by following the specific parts for this project!  Personally I had to abandon my preferred IDE, IntelliJ IDEA, because things just weren't working correctly for some reason.  It happens.*

#### A preamble for Windows users
Windows Power Shell / Git Bash will save you a ton of headaches when we do commandline stuff. Personally, I also use ConEmu to improve the UX (look'n'feel) of these shells.

If you try to follow along with `cmd`, gosh rest your puppers.
