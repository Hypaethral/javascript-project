# Headstart Javascript Project

If you want to try this project, your job is to replicate an image like this

using HTML, javascript, and CSS.  The structure of your solution and the means of accomplishing it are totally up to you!

I'll show you my solution when you've finished, and we can talk about differences, similarities, and what a reactified (React is the framework we'll be using on the egg-spaces project) version might look like!  #bridginggaps

# Tips
* There are a ton of ways to accomplish this!  If you run into issues or aren't sure where to start, hit me up or make an issue in this repository
* This project can actually be done entirely in your browser: https://jsfiddle.net/
* If you find yourself making a ton of variable names or writing a ton of HTML, it's probably worth it to invest some time looking at javascript loops and whatever the heck a ["DOM"](http://callmenick.com/post/basics-javascript-dom-manipulation) is (or, [what it isn't](https://css-tricks.com/dom/)).
* It doesn't matter what colors/sizes are used for the squares -- plus, you'll probably save time by writing some javascript to make colors for you :)
